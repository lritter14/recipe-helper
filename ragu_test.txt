Pork Ragu Pasta Recipe

Gather Your Ingredients & Tools

A mix of ground pork and... well, more ingredients (you'll figure it out)
Some onion-y things
Carrots for color and sweetness
Celery for that fresh vibe
Garlic to make everything better
Canned tomatoes or fresh ones, whichever you prefer
Olive oil for sautéing

Pasta of your choice (pappardelle, fettuccine, spaghetti... the list goes on)
Parmesan cheese because, why not?
Fresh parsley for garnish
Get Cooking!

Brown the pork: Get a large pan over medium-high heat and add some olive oil. Throw in the ground pork and cook until it's browned, breaking it up into smaller pieces as you go.
Add some aromatics: Once the pork is browned, add some chopped onion, carrots, celery, and garlic to the pan. Cook until they're softened and fragrant – think 5-7 minutes.
Time for tomatoes!: Add canned or fresh tomatoes (crushed or diced) to the pan, along with a pinch of salt, pepper, and any other herbs you like. Let it all simmer together for at least 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened and the flavors have melded together.
Pasta time!: While the ragu is simmering away, cook your pasta according to the package instructions. You want it al dente – not too hard, not too soft.
Combine the magic: Once the pasta's done, add it to the pan with the ragu sauce and toss everything together until the pasta's well coated.
Finish with cheese and parsley: Sprinkle some grated Parmesan over the top of your pasta and garnish with fresh parsley.
Tweak & Enjoy!

Remember, this is an unstructured recipe – feel free to experiment and adjust the flavors to your liking. If you want a spicier ragu, add some red pepper flakes. If you prefer a creamier sauce, stir in some heavy cream or mascarpone cheese. And if you're feeling adventurous, try adding other ingredients like mushrooms, bell peppers, or even some chopped bacon!
